Excercise 3:
Identify:
What is a fibonacci number, and what does the sequence look like

Develop:
Make a list of fibonacci numbers, along with their nth identifier
Or use a recursive algorithm

Devise:
Write out a list of fibonacci numbers, each with their nth position; for example the number 8 would be the 6th number in the sequence
Develop a recursive algorithm to use n = n-1 + n-2; where n represents the nth number in the sequence
